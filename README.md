# hello-world
just another repository.  
My name is Wren, I enjoy spending time with my kids walking through the beautiful park and walking trails that take us to our local library.  We can easily spend several hours there before heading home along the same path where we can watch nature change through the seasons and identify different plants and animals in the area.
