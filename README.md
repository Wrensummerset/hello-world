# hello-world
just another repository.  
My name is Wren, I enjoy spending time with my kids walking through the beautiful park and walking trails that take us to our local library.  We can easily spend several hours there before heading home along the same path where we can watch nature change through the seasons and identify different plants and animals in the area.


Today, We had a really wonderful speaker who talked about leaning in.  This concept is one of the most valuable that I'm gaining in this class.  I think there is a real hesitation when it comes to learning something new. My own hesitation stems I think from an uncertainty of how to approach the topic.  Where do I begin?  No one is handing me a textbook necessarily, which guides me along from one concept to the next, building on a cohesive knowledge base.  So for example, today, I was trying to understand Git.  I had Git and Github confused at first, so I had to recognize that Git wasn't Github, but I needed to put commits into Github  ... ????  It took some "leaning in" but I'm slowly sorting.  Which took backtracking.  As I researched "What is Git"  I then had to google, "What is modern version control system"  At which point things started clicking, and I have slowly been able to work back through the information I didn't understand originally.  *sigh*  =)  Lean in...last pull request thank you wren for letting me use yours...
